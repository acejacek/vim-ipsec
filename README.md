ipsec.conf syntax highlighting for vim.

All I've done is rolled Bruce Christensen's [ipsec.conf syntax highlighting](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=312) 
into a plugin because I'm lazy and use 
[Plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug/) to automatically install things everywhere via my common .vimrc
